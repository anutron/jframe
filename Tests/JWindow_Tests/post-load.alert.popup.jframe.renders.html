				I'm a post-load alert. You can click "ok" or the modal layer below me to close me.
		</div>
		<p>Despite the alert, this content still rendered. My popup is in a div with the class .alert_popup but <em>also</em> has .jframe_renders. This allows the page below the popup to still render the response (without the popup content of course).</p>
