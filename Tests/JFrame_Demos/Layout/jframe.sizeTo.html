			<p>This is content that is stretched to the height of the JFrame - 70px (this isn't 100px because of padding added to this container and the header). This element's background is light grey and should go all the way to the bottom of the window. Further, the overflow (scroll) should be limited to this lower element (because it has overflow:auto assigned to it).</p>
