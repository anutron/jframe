description: Any JFrame response that has a root-level child element with the class .partial_refresh will find all elements that have a property defined for data-partial-id that is unique to the response and only update them. If there is a mismatch in the response such that the number of and ids of partials in the previous state do not match the return state, an alert will be shown the user that the entire view will be updated that they can cancel, if they so choose.

			Partials are comprised of instructions in HTML responses that mark areas of the document that should be
			compaired against previous responses. These areas's raw HTML (the HTML returned from the server, not the
			current DOM state, which may have classes or style attributes or even new DOM elements in place) is compared
			to the previous response. When there's a mis-match in the response, only those elements that have changed
			are run through the JFrame filters to configure them for display and then replace their expired counterparts.

			Each area that may have elements that should be checked is identified with the class "partial_refresh" on some
			container; often a div wrapping the entire response.

			Each individual item that might be refreshed must be marked with a data-partial-id property that is unique
			to the JFrame (i.e. multiple app windows can have id overlap).

			If you need to support the loading of additional content after the fact, such as with loading additional Ajax
			elements within the frame or if the response may return more or fewer items than the previous response, then
			you must add some additional instrumentation to your HTML. Specifically, you *must* define a container where
			new elements are injected. This is typically the immediate parent of the partials, like so:

			Example w/ just partials and container
			<div data-partial-container-id="div1">
				<p data-partial-id="p1">foo</p>
				<p data-partial-id="p2">bar</p>
			</div>

			In some cases, such as with tables, you may wish to add "lines" between the partials and the container. A good
			example here is a table which has partials for individual td elements, but new tr elements may come and go.

			Example w/ partials, container, and lines
			<tbody data-partial-container-id="tbody1">
				<tr data-partial-line-id="tr1">
					<td data-partial-id="id1"></td>
					<td data-partial-id="id2"></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>

			When the above markup is used, new partials may appear (the tds) and the parent element with the data-partial-line-id
			will be used for injection instead. Note that this id, and the container id, must also be unique to the frame.

			Both lines and partials will be injected in their relative position; i.e. if in the above example our response returned
			a new tr line afer tr1, the new row would be found in the response, the reponse's DOM tree would be inspected and
			the previous row would be found there. It's id is "tr1". The *live* DOM tree - the one the user sees - would be searched
			for an element with that line-id. The new line would be injected after it.

			When using ajax to load in new content (such as with the AjaxLoad linker) you'll likely load new content in ouside
			the scope of this refresh handler. I.e. you'll handle the response and inject the new items yourself. In this case
			partial refresh needs only to store the original request state for future checksums. To accomplish this, set the
			options of the request to have the onlyProcessPartials flag set to true. This will run the ajax response through
			this renderer, find the new partial elements, and store their initial state for checking later.
